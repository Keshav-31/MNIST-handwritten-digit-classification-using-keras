1) Libraries required : numpy,pandas,tensorflow,matplotlib,h5py,keras.
2) Unzip the dataset and place the files in the same folder as your model.
3) In case you don't want to train the whole model,you can simply go to the bottom of the notebook and load the model directly. But remeber to load the datasets before that.
